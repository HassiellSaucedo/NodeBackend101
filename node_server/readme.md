# Understanding NodeJS and it's server creation

Used tools:
- node version v10.19.0
- Visual Studio Code 1.59.1
- Postman v8.11.1 for Linux 


## How to exec

- use this command to execute the server example code:

`node node_server/server.js`

- use this command to execute the echo-server with "POST" method example code:

`node node_arquitectura/echo-server.js `

(You'll need to use Postman here to send the 'POST' request to the server to get the response.)


- use this command to execute the Bday-weekday example code:

`node node_arquitectura/Bday-weekday.js`

(You'll need to use Postman here to send the 'POST' request with your birthday to get the server to respond with your birthda weekday.)
